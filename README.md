This program is for language learning. It has auth, google auth, blog, courses, users and other facilities.

```
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```
python manage.py migrate
```
```
python manage.py runserver
```
And to do google auth, you need to go to google console, create a project, take auth secret key and client id and add it to the application in the admin panel. (Look it up on the web).

Thank you for your attention
